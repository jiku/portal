# jiku: site

Base site for `jiku` (apps).

## STATE

### Using Meteor edge (2016-10-19 00:50)

`bump` updates so `start` can be used. `start:edge` doesn't.
Find a way to use vars and reuse nested scripts in `package.json`, etc (so current becomes arg for last, etc)?

### TODO: PNG to SVG for buttons (2016-10-17)

Getting closer.

### CSS to styled-components for buttons (2016-10-17 ~01:00)

### Fetch assets (MD, SVG) from server using [Meteor methods, async/await, promises] (2016-10-14 11:02)

Added async fetching of Markdown from server (through Meteor methods and (server-only) Asset API). Can't do import/require on the client with Meteor? See [Meteor: Forums: Importing Assets - Image](https://forums.meteor.com/t/importing-assets-image/30266/2?u=jiku). Made notes and video too (search `meteor react ramda asset` or see `../Notes`).

### Setup/origin (2016-10-09 13:10)

Merged `nutrica/app` (Ramda pipelining React components, TernJS, ESLint, etc) with `jiku/again` (Storybook, Wallaby, etc). Removed pesky local dev NPM dependencies (`/Volumes/Data/Dev` to `/Volumes/Dev` related?). Starting in `src/` with `meteor --release=1.4.2-beta.9 --port 7007` (great rebuild speeds).
